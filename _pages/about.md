I will be joining the [Department of Systems Engineering at City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/sye/) as a tenure-track assistant professor in June 2025. 

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University in 2024. I received M.S. from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University in 2018 and B.E. from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University in 2016.

Openings
======
I am actively looking for Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2025. If your research interests are compatible with mine, please contact me with your CV and unofficial transcripts. 

Contact: shutian.liu AT cityu DOT edu DOT hk

Research Interests
======

My research interests lie broadly in Game Theory, Optimization/Control Theory, Risk Analytics/Management, Network Science, and their applications in multidisciplinary areas such as Adversarial AI, Socio-Technical Systems Security, Human Factors, Misinformation, and Public Health.

Some of my recent interests include:
1. Information design/manipulation in partially observable Markov decision processes and games of incomplete information.
1. Risk preference maneuvering in data-driven stochastic optimization and insurance contract design.
1. Population games over complex networks: epidemic modelling and public health policy design.
1. Information sharing network reconfiguration in AI for health.
