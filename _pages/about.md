I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Systems Engineering at City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/sye/). 

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University, M.S. from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, and B.E. from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University.

Openings
======
**I am actively looking for Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2026. If your research interests are compatible with mine, please don't hesitate to contact me with your CV and transcripts.** 

Contact: shutian.liu AT cityu DOT edu DOT hk

Research Interests
======

My research interests lie broadly in Game Theory, Optimization/Control, Risk Analytics/Management, Network Science, and their applications in multidisciplinary areas such as Adversarial AI, Socio-Technical Systems Security, Human Factors, Misinformation, and Public Health.

Some of my recent interests include:
1. Information design in partially observable systems and games of incomplete information.
1. Risk preference and belief maneuvering in data-driven stochastic optimization.
1. Population/Meanfield games over complex networks.
1. Cybersecutiy, cyber deception, cyber insurance.
1. Epidemic modelling/control and public health policy design.
1. Federated learning and strategic network design in AI for health.
